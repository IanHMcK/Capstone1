        <h2>Summary of Experience</h2>
        <p>During the course of my career working in UK, Europe, Kazakhstan, Saudi Arabia, North Africa and West Africa I have gained experience in most aspects of electrical engineering in the oil & gas, petrochemical, offshore including electrical building services, HV/LV power distribution networks, controls systems, upstream/downstream petrochemical and gas installations, hazardous area equipment, instrumentation, fire & gas and offshore. I have experience of working on the conceptual stage (FEED) to design, construction and commissioning phases of projects. I have acted in a (PMC) project managing role, acting on behalf of the Client, overseeing the EPC contractor. I am a keen conscientious person who can adapt to being a key member of any project team. I also have experience in leading multi-national design teams. I am familiar with latest revisions of both National, and International Codes & Standards including Russian / CIS Standards</p>
